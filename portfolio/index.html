                <p> My name is Naysa Alex! This webpage has been designed for my course, <i> The Fundamentals of Information Systems</i>, or ISTM 210. 
                    I am a freshman Business major, planning to pursue an undergraduate degree in <a href ="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/business/information-operations-management/management-information-systems-bba/">Management Information Systems</a> (MIS). Along with this, I plan to minor in <a href ="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/computer-science/minor/">Computer Science</a> and <a href ="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/cybersecurity-minor/">Cybersecurity</a>.

                    Growing up, I always loved the idea of solving the unimagineable, the riddles, the puzzles or even the wordly mysteries. When I was introduced to coding at a young age, I found it intriguing and comforting as it became the outlet through which I could satisfy my craving to solve endless puzzles. However, through my involvement in clubs such as FBLA(Future Business Leaders of America) in highschool, I quickly found an interest in the field of Business as well. When it was time to choose a major, I was inbetween choosing to pursue a degree in either Engineering or Business. MIS seemed to be the best fit major for me as the scope of it would allow me to see into both fields relatively well. By adding on the computer science and cybersecurity minors, I am also able to add more technical value to my skillset. After completing almost one whole academic year in this major, I am even more sure of how perfect this decision was for my situation. My knowledge has already grown vastly in areas of Business and Engineering and I look forward to furthering it in the coming years.
